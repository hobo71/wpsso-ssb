WPSSO extension to add Social Sharing Buttons with support for hashtags, short URLs, bbPress, BuddyPress, WooCommerce, and much more.

== Description ==

<p><img src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-ssb/assets/icon-256x256.png" width="256" height="256" style="width:33%;min-width:128px;max-width:256px;float:left;margin:0 40px 20px 0;" />Add traditional social sharing buttons from social websites to Posts / Pages, Custom Post Types, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/">bbPress</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/">BuddyPress</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/">WooCommerce</a> product pages, and many more. The sharing buttons can be included in the content, excerpt, widget, CSS floating sidebar, and on admin editing pages.</p>

WPSSO Social Sharing Buttons (WPSSO SSB) works in conjunction with the [WordPress Social Sharing Optimization (WPSSO)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/) plugin, extending its features with additional settings pages, tabs, and options to provide traditional social sharing buttons. WPSSO SSB sources JavaScript provided by each social website asynchronously and &mdash; using WPSSO as its framework &mdash; provides customized and accurate information to social websites.

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Looking for Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons?</strong></p>

<p>WPSSO SSB uses traditional social sharing buttons provided by each social website. If you're looking for a responsive / flat design style, have a look at the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-rrssb/">WPSSO Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons (WPSSO RRSSB)</a> plugin. The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) used by WPSSO RRSSB resize automatically to their container size, so they always look great from any device (phone, tablet, laptop, etc.), including high resolution retina displays.</p>

= Uses the WPSSO Framework =

The WordPress Social Sharing Optimization (WPSSO) plugin is required to use the WPSSO SSB extension. You can use the Free version of WPSSO SSB with *both* the Free and Pro versions of WPSSO, but [WPSSO SSB Pro](http://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-ssb/) requires the use of the [WPSSO Pro](http://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso/) plugin as well. [Purchase the WPSSO Social Sharing Buttons (WPSSO SSB) Pro extension](http://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-ssb/) (includes a *No Risk 30 Day Refund Policy*).

= Proven Performance =

WPSSO and WPSSO SSB are *fast and coded for performance*, making full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching). WPSSO loads only the library files and object classes it needs, keeping it small, fast, and yet still able to support a wide range of 3rd party integration features.

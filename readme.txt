**WPSSO Core add-on to provide Social Sharing Buttons with support for hashtags, short URLs, bbPress, BuddyPress, WooCommerce, and much more.**

Include traditional social sharing buttons in the content, excerpt, widget, CSS sidebar, shortcodes, templates, and *admin editing pages* &mdash; share your posts and pages directly from the editor! Do you use bbPress, BuddyPress, or WooCommerce? The Pro version of WPSSO Social Sharing Buttons (aka WPSSO SSB) includes special integration modules to add social sharing buttons to even more locations!

WPSSO Social Sharing Buttons (aka WPSSO SSB) sources JavaScript provided by social websites asynchronously and &mdash; using WPSSO as its framework &mdash; provides accurate and customized information to each social website.

WPSSO Social Sharing Buttons is *incredibly fast* and coded for performance &mdash; WPSSO Core and its add-ons make full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching), and load only the PHP library files and object classes they need, keeping their code small, fast, and light. WPSSO Core and its add-ons are also fully tested and compatible with PHP v7.x (PHP v5.4 or better required).

<h3>WPSSO Core Plugin Prerequisite</h3>

WPSSO Social Sharing Buttons (aka WPSSO SSB) is an add-on for the WPSSO Core plugin &mdash; which creates complete &amp; accurate meta tags and Schema markup from your existing content for social sharing, Social Media Optimization (SMO), Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Google Rich Cards, Pinterest Rich Pins, etc.

The Free add-on plugin works with either the Free or Pro version of WPSSO Core. The [WPSSO SSB Pro add-on](https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-ssb/?utm_source=wpssossb-readme-prereq) uses many WPSSO Core Pro features and requires an active and licensed [WPSSO Core Pro plugin](https://wpsso.com/?utm_source=wpssossb-readme-prereq).
